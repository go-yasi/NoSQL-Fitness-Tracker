# NoSQL Fitness Tracker

## Description 
The goal of this assignment was to create a workout tracker using a Mongo (NoSQL) database with a Mongoose scheme and handle routes with Express. I was given starter code for the front end, but had to create the routes to get, post, put, and delete to and from the database.

## User Story
"As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled."  

## Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout. The user should be able to: add exercises to the most recent workout plan, add new exercises to a new workout plan, view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` (Dashboard) page, and view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` (Dashboard) page.

## Conclusion
I enjoyed developing this application because it gave me the opportunity to practice working with a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB (with the Mongoose ORM). In the process, I learned some of the many advantages of using a NoSQL database: 
- They can handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (therefore creating dynamic schemas!).
- The are non-relational, which makes them more flexible and less restrictive.
- They make it easy to implement object-oriented coding paradigms such as ES6.
  
After having worked both with SQL and NoSQL databases, I now know that I personally prefer using a relational (SQL) data structure. While NoSQL databases can be considered "easier" to use because they are non-relational and are more flexible in terms of document structure, I still prefer structured query language and predefined schemas!
