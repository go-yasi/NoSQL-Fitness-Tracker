# NoSql Fitness Tracker

## Description 
The goal of this assignment was to create a workout tracker using a Mongo database with a Mongoose scheme and handle routes with Express. I was given starter code for the front end, but had to create the routes to get, post, put and delete to and from the NoSQL database.

## User Story
"As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled."  

## Acceptance Criteria
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to: add exercises to the most recent workout plan, add new exercises to a new workout plan, view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` (Dashboard) page, and view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` (Dashboard) page.
